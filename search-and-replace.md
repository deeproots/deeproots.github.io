In the course of editing these books, I've come up with a list of things that should absolutely not exist. For instance, the example we used in the [poems](/poems) tutorial: there's no justifiable reason that the character `■` should exist in any of the books in the project. So when we see it, it's a pretty good indicator that there is a problem that needs to be fixed. 

That's where what I've called "predetermined searches" come in - it's a list of searches that will always bring up problem areas that need to be looked at. 

Search                   Looking For…
--------                 -------------
`(\.|,|!|\?)\S`          Any punctuation without a space to its right.

And that's all!
