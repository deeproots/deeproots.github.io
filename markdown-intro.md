First, the format the books are in itself: **Markdown**. [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) is a very simple format that allows us to have text that is both (a) very readable, and (b) easily convertible to a multitude of different formats. 

You can [go here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) to read about the basics of Markdown, but to give you some examples: to make something italics you put one asterisk on either side, like \**this*\*. To make it bold, **\*\*two asterisks\*\* **. 

As you can see, Markdown is just a plain text with a little bit of markup. The files are small, it's extremely flexible, and it's easy to read for hours on end! ;-) And yet the benefits are profound - it allows going to the web, to ePub, to PDF, with very little additional work.
