All of the books we'll be editing together will be in: **Markdown**. What's Markdown? Good question! [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) is a very simple format that allows us to have text that is both (a) very readable, and (b) easily convertible to a multitude of different formats. 

You can [go here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) to read about the basics of Markdown, but to give you some examples: to make something italics you put one asterisk on either side, like \**this*\*. To make it bold, \*\***two asterisks**\*\*. A blank line between each paragraph. And it goes on from there - super simple stuff that quickly becomes second nature. 

And probably the most important thing for our purposes, headings in a Markdown file are done like this:

# \# Header 1

## \#\# Header 2

### \#\#\# Header 3

#### \#\#\#\# Header 4

##### \#\#\#\#\# Header 5

###### \#\#\#\#\#\# Header 6

And it's as simple as that! Just start the heading line with the correct number of pound signs, and we're good to go. **Chapters will be first level headings** in the DRL books, so that, along with italics (and some special use cases like [poems](/poems/)) are the most common things you'll see when you're editing the raw book text - book publishers in the 1800s (when most of our sources were printed) didn't use bold or have hyperlinks too often! ðŸ˜‰

So, as you can see, Markdown is super simple and easy - it's just a plain text with a little bit of markup. The files are small, it's extremely flexible, and it's easy to read for hours on end! And yet the benefits are profound - it allows going to the web, to ePub, to PDF, with very little additional work.

Be careful - once you get used to it you'll be wanting to write everything in Markdown!
