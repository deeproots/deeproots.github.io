First of all, thanks so much for your interest in helping to edit this great books from Christian history. In the midst of proofreading and formatting, forking repos and submitting pull requests, let us keep the main thing the main thing: we are **serving our brothers and sisters** in Christ all around the world by making this books available and accessible to them, with as few distractions (errors!) as possible!

Just as these books are in process, so is this documentation, so please bear that it mind as you read. And if there is a question you have about the editing process that hasn't been answered, the best thing to do is open a new [issue](/issues/) so that we can discuss it and the whole community can benefit!

As you can see in the navigation on the left, there are overviews of the tools that we use in the editing, as well as step by step tutorials to get you started. Thanks again!
