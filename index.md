First of all, thanks so much for your interest in helping to edit these great books from Christian history. It's such a gift to hear the wisdom of those who have gone before us, and I'm thankful to be working alongside you in this project! We're **serving our brothers and sisters in Christ**  all around the world by making this books available and accessible to them, with as few distractions (errors!) as possible!

Just as these books are in process, so is this documentation, so please bear that it mind as you read. And if there is a question you have about the editing process that hasn't been answered, the best thing to do is open a new [issue](/issues/) so that we can discuss it and the whole community can benefit!

As you can see in the navigation on the left, there are overviews of the tools that we use in the editing, as well as step by step tutorials to get you started. And as we check punctuation and correct formatting, may the words on the screen bring us closer to our Savior!

Luke
